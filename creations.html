   At Salesforce during the summer of 2019 i was asked to redesign an internal team logo for the Platform Solution Engineering team. Using Adobe Illustrator and the SF graphics kit for inspiration, I went through the entire design process during this project. I began with many iterative logos that had small differences and narrowed it down to a select few and from those few the whole platform team voted and decided on one logo. However once the team decided on a logo one of the team members pointed out that the winning logo wasn’t gender neutral so i made some quick edits and the final product is an on-brand gender neutral logo utilizing our mascots for the PTS team. <br> - Charles

<p class="creations">The last major project i worked on all summer was the platform POP Community. i was approached by a superior with this project. He told me how the platform pillar owner site was housed on a google site and showed me how the site was off branding. Diving into the project i learned how to use the community builder. I started by migrating the content from the google site to the community. One of the first problems i had was with learning the nomenclature of the community builder. Even though it is mostly drag and drop, the components are named imprecisely or at least not adequately. Once i figured out what component did what, i had a frame built for the website. One small issue i had was when i tried adding in the I frames for the google sites that needed to be embedded into the community. I had to learn some quick HTML and was able to get some edits in and the problem was fixed. Next was adding branding, getting the color scheme, fonts, and images on point to align with Salesforce branding. I made from scratch the tile images for navigation and most of the banner images on the site. One of the cool new adjustments i made was converting the documents page from a static text block of links into a tile based system that fed off of a salesforce record so whoever manages the site after i leave can easily add in new records for the newer product councils. And the website will update on its own. The ongoing issue i had with the community was getting the authentication to work. Before this community can go fully public we have to make sure that salesforce users are the only ones that can access the site. In order to accomplish this the site needs to have an authenticator set up and a registration handler coded into an apex class. This has been an ongoing issue and when i left i handed off the community to my manager so the authentication issue can be solved and the website and my work won’t be going to waste. <br> - Charles </p>

Not too long ago a friend approached me asking for my help developing a logo for the startup company he worked for. After several sessions of tweaking we were able to finish with this logo incorporating wiring and microchip pieces along the wall of a simple building.
